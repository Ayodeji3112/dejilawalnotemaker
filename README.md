# Note Taker Application

The Note Taker application is a concise and efficient solution for writing, saving, and managing notes. Built with an Express.js backend, this application facilitates the storage and retrieval of note data from a JSON file, seamlessly integrating with a pre-developed front end. Designed with small business owners in mind, Note Taker helps organize thoughts and tasks, ensuring no detail is missed.

## Features

- **Intuitive Note Management**: Create, save, view, and delete notes all in one place.
- **Persistent Storage**: Notes are stored in a JSON file on the server, ensuring data persistence across sessions.
- **Express.js Backend**: A robust Express.js server handles API requests, serving static files and managing note data efficiently.
- **Deployment Ready**: Fully prepared for deployment on platforms like Render, enabling easy access from anywhere.

## User Story

## Acceptance Criteria
